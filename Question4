"""i. Write a recursive function sum_of_numbers to calculate the sum of numbers within a given range 
that takes start and end as parameters. The function should work whether start is less or greater than 
end.
ii. Write a function called input_function to ask the user to enter the starting and ending numbers 
and call sum_of_numbers with those arguments and prints the result.
iii. Write the same function sum_of_numbers to calculate the sum of numbers but this time it takes a 
list of integers as an argument and calculates the sum of the integers in the list. Invoke the function 
in the main program."""

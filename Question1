"""i. Write a function called int_return that takes an integer as input and returns the same integer.
ii. Write a function called add that takes any number as its input and returns that sum with 2 added.
iii. Write a function called greet that takes any name (string), and greets the person.
    E.g. “Hello Bob! Nice to meet you!” (Only returns the greeting string, printing is done in
     the main program.)
iv. Write a function, accum, that takes a list of integers as input and returns the sum of those integers.
v. Write a function, length, that takes in a list as the input. If the length of the list is greater
   than or equal to 5, return “Longer than 5”. If the length is less than 5, return “Less than 5”.
vi. You will need to write two functions for this problem. The first function, divide that takes in
   any number and returns that same number divided by 2. The second function called sum should take
  any number, divide it by 2, and add 6. It should return this new number. You should call the divide
   function within the sum function. Do not worry about decimals."""
